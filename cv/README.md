# Computer Vision 


## Supervised Learning
Results : 


Train Accuracy ~ 84%


Test Accuracy ~ 64%
            
Conclusions : Since the dataset as a whole had only 5000 examples, the model faces overfitting. One possible way to increase the test accuracy is by having more training examples



## Pseudo Labelling : 
- Since there are memory limits in Google Colab and I don't have a CUDA compatible GPU, I havent been able to complete this part. The code has been written in reference to the blog post given.



## SimCLR :
- I have refered this [blog](https://zablo.net/blog/post/understanding-implementing-simclr-guide-eli5-pytorch/) and was facing an error in the end. Due to time constraints, I was not able to complete.
